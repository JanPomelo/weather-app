This Website was made to get some practice with fetching data from the Web. Furthermore it is to strenghten the knowledge in working with callbacks, promises and async await.

Furthermore, the question for the location is also implemented for a better user experience.

For further work a menu for choosing a theme or background is planned, but for now learning more at the Odin Project has more priority.

For the next projects, the focus is on learning to committing more frequently and commenting code.
